Q1) What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
A1) When we initialize or create a new repository, .gitignore file is created by default. It has a few
file extensions- It is basically telling git which files it should ignore when commit something to 
our repository in GitHub.

Q2) What does fast-forward in git mean?
A2) If master has no changes or commits, instead of making a new commit,Git will simply refer or point master 
to the feature branch's most recent commit  (the HEAD pointer moves to the feature branch's recent commit)


Q3) Why should you have different branches?
A4) Each developer can work seperately from other developers by branching out from master - This makes 
everyone's work easier as they don't have to depend on each other's work all the time and they can avoid the
hassle of shifting their files back and forth from each other. Finally, everyone can merge all their work to 
master. Additionally, it makes it easier for Git to merge versions.


Q4) In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
A4) In a common project, there is only one remote repository, where different project members can create their own
branches, make changes in them and push their change to those branches and finally merge into master branch after
ensuring that there are no conflicts.
